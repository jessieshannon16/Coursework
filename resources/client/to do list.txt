Things to do:
- For learn.html:
        1.Output all questionId into an array, then use a randomiser to randomly choose a value of i, which will be the id used.
        2. Return this id to the API, and use it to select the question
        3. return this to the js

- For feed.html & learn.html:
        Use images of sponge and taco as buttons (like avatar stats sorta) and onclick triggers a pagereload that increases their avatars score (api's to update scores)

- For dates:
        1. First check years the same
        2. Then check months the same, if not subtract current from previous, subtract 1 and multiply that total by 30.5 (finds average no of days)
        3. subtract current day from previous, if month change, subtract previous from 30.5 and + current
