Things to do:
1. Change the foreign key set up for the avatarstats table
2. Resize the images on the login screen
3. Make the login screen the default screen (probabaly not difficult just type in a separate url?)
4. Fix the login screen layout
5. Make sure the user has a place where they can choose what avatar they want


Control the avatar page with 2 seperate href pages in order to simplify the problem!!!!
