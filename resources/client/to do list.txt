Things to do:
1. Make sure that once a user registers, they are automatically logged in
2. Find out why the ResultSet is closed and how to fix it
3. Change the foreign key set up for the avatarstats table
4. Resize the images on the login screen
5. Make the login screen the default screen (probabaly not difficult just type in a separate url?)
